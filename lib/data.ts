      "Created chatbot backend using MERN and integrated NLP.js library.",
    longDescription:
      `üìò <strong>WanderMate-TourBot ‚Äì Personal Travel Assistant for Tourists</strong><br><br>
This project -Mobile Application - was developed to create an intelligent, all-in-one travel assistant for tourists, designed to help them explore new destinations, discover attractions, get travel tips, and more. I worked as the backend developer, with a team handling the frontend and chatbot training.<br><br>

üß† <strong>Backend Development and Database Design</strong><br>
For this project, I was responsible for designing the backend and structuring the database. Initially, I considered using MySQL for the database but later switched to MongoDB due to the complexity of storing chat history, unique user bios for registered guides, and other dynamic content. MongoDB's flexibility allowed us to scale the database as the project grew.<br><br>

üéØ <strong>Project Vision and Goal</strong><br>
The goal of this chatbot is to assist tourists by providing quick, relevant information about destinations, available attractions, and travel-related questions. The chatbot is capable of understanding user queries, offering real-time suggestions, and learning from past interactions to improve its responses over time. We aimed to build a system that could scale seamlessly with user demand.<br><br>

üõ†Ô∏è <strong>Key Modules and Features</strong><br><br>

1. ü§ñ <strong>Chatbot Integration (Using NLP.js)</strong><br>
   ‚ú¶ The chatbot utilizes <strong>NLP.js</strong> for natural language processing. I worked on the backend integration, while my teammates were responsible for training the chatbot.<br>
   ‚ú¶ We set up the chatbot on a separate port to ensure scalability and flexibility, but later realized that this approach created issues when attempting to implement a contextual-based system. All logins shared the same NLP instance, making it less user-friendly for multiple users, leading me to understand the importance of synchronization in a microservices architecture.<br><br>

2. üó∫Ô∏è <strong>Tourist Recommendations</strong><br>
   ‚ú¶ The bot provides personalized recommendations for restaurants, attractions, and travel tips based on the user's preferences. It also links to guides who are registered within the app, offering a richer travel experience.<br><br>

3. üìù <strong>Task Management (To-Do List)</strong><br>
   ‚ú¶ Tourists can use the app to keep track of their planned activities and to-dos while traveling. This helps them stay organized and ensures they don't miss out on any must-see attractions.<br><br>

4. üìö <strong>Guide Registration and Management</strong><br>
   ‚ú¶ Local tour guides can register with the app and provide their profiles, which tourists can view when seeking personalized tours or guides. Each guide has a unique bio and specialized information about the destinations they cover.<br><br>

5. üß≥ <strong>Map and Navigation Features</strong><br>
   ‚ú¶ Integrated map functionalities allow tourists to find nearby attractions and get directions in real-time. The integration of this feature was crucial for user engagement.<br><br>

üí° <strong>Challenges and Learning Moments</strong><br>
<ul>
  <li>ü§ñ <strong>NLP.js Integration</strong>: Initially, our chatbot training was done in isolation, and the bot was hosted on a separate port. As we tried to make the system context-aware, we encountered issues with sharing the same NLP instance among different users. This taught me valuable lessons about synchronization, scaling, and performance in a microservices-based architecture.</li><br>
  <li>üì± <strong>React Native Development</strong>: Although I was focused on the backend, I got a chance to understand the workflow of React Native development, especially the importance of using the right console tools. React Native doesn't always show errors up front when integration issues arise, so it was crucial to implement strategic console logs to track progress and ensure everything was running smoothly.</li><br>
  <li>‚öôÔ∏è <strong>Microservices and Scalability</strong>: One of the key realizations was how important it is to manage service interactions efficiently, especially when dealing with microservices. The lack of synchronization between different services could quickly lead to performance and usability issues.</li><br>
</ul>

üß† <strong>Technologies Used</strong><br>
<ul>
  <li>Backend: MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js</li>
  <li>Frontend: React Native (handled by frontend team)</li>
  <li>Other Tools: NLP.js (handled by team), Puppeteer, Fuse.js, WebSockets</li>
</ul><br>

üîß <strong>What I Learned</strong><br>
<ul>
  <li>‚ú¶How to design a flexible, scalable backend system with MongoDB, focusing on the dynamic nature of the data we were handling (chat history, guide profiles).</li>
  <li>‚ú¶Gained insight into the React Native development process and how to address errors and debugging challenges that arise during integration.</li>
  <li>‚ú¶The importance of synchronization between services and how failure to do so can impact user experience and performance.</li>
  <li>‚ú¶Real-time communication: We utilized WebSockets for real-time data updates, which was crucial for the chat functionalities.</li>

üí° <strong>Lessons & Realizations During Development</strong><br>
This was my first hands-on experience with concepts like:<br>
<ul>
  <li>‚ú¶Authentication and authorization</li>
  <li>‚ú¶URL parameter security</li>
  <li>‚ú¶The importance of RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) ‚ú¶ although I  wasn‚Äôt able to fully implement it fully, I discovered the need for it.</li>
</ul><br>
Initially, I used simple numeric IDs (like /users/1, /users/2) in URLs for accessing data, but soon realized:<br>
<ul>
  <li>‚ú¶Anyone could access another user's data just by guessing the ID.</li>
  <li>‚ú¶This led to security flaws, which I learned to resolve by adding login checks and role validations.</li>
  <li>‚ú¶I revised and rebuilt the authentication logic at least three times to achieve a more secure and robust flow.</li>
</ul><br>
The project helped me understand the value of data protection, secure access, and validation, even if the implementation wasn‚Äôt perfect.<br><br>
